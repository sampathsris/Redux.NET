
# Redux.NET

A predictable state container for Microsoft.NET applications, inspired by
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and the [other Redux.NET](https://github.com/GuillaumeSalles/redux.NET),
(specifically, the lack of `CombineReducers` in that project).

DISCLAIMER: Right now, this is just a project for fun, and not even remotely
ready for production.
